social media and e-commerce are reshaping the marketplace, one channel was 
receiving universal plaudits for its effectiveness in driving sales – 
WeChat commerce.</span></p><div class="mce-template"><div class="row template-11"><div class="img-lg col-xs-12"><div class="tmce_placeholder"><figure><a href="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/International-Market-News/Global-and-Domestic-Cosmetic-Brands-Bid-for-Market-Share-via-WeChat/imn/en/1/1X3AYEO6/1X0A2JC3.htm#"><img class="contentImg" title="Photo: The mobile commerce pavilion: Centre-stage at the China Beauty Expo." border="0" alt="Photo: The mobile commerce pavilion: Centre-stage at the China Beauty Expo." src="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/resources/MI_Portal/Article/imn/2015/06/469848/1434091118540_15-6-1c1-1_469848.jpg"/></a><figcaption><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The

impact of e-commerce. Fittingly then, the 20th China Beauty Expo took New Trends 
in Social Media/E-Commerce as it is principal focus. This year, the 
Shanghai-based event addressed the many changes all-things-digital have brought 
to every aspect of the cosmetics industry, including products, marketing, sales, 
channels, distribution and management, with a particular acknowledgment of the 
importance of the O2O trading model.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Over recent years, e-commerce has entered a new and more mature phase. The 
convergence of social media and e-commerce, along with related brand activity, 
has resulted in three developments in the way consumers access online shopping. 
Firstly, there is the way digital media function as a guide to just what 
products to buy. Then there is the unilateral and multilateral sharing and 
interaction between users and vendors. Thirdly – and arguably most significantly 
– there has been the establishment of a series of multi-tier rebates for sharing 
posts within social media networks – a clear incentive for customers to become 
advocates.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">There is little doubt that WeChat commerce is currently the most 
significant channel, with cosmetics and personal care products inevitably 
gravitating toward it. This has seen increasing number of domestic brands are 
now signing up for the service.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">WeChat commerce represents a new form of e-commerce, one where 
companies or individuals open shops via its platform. These shops mainly operate 
in one of two ways – B2C shops using public WeChat accounts and C2C 
shops operating within circles of friends. As with Taobao, 
WeChat commerce also has two streams: B2C and C2C. The difference here 
is that WeChat commerce makes use of its parent platform&#39;s ability to 
connect everything – social sharing, recommendations to close friends and 
presentation of products to a circle of friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Overall business flow via WeChat commerce mainly has four 
components. Principally, these are Weimob shops on transaction 
platforms, marketing add-ons, a distribution system and user-to-user sharing and 
promotion.</span></p><div class="mce-template"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 img-md img-left"><div class="tmce_placeholder"><figure><a href="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/International-Market-News/Global-and-Domestic-Cosmetic-Brands-Bid-for-Market-Share-via-WeChat/imn/en/1/1X3AYEO6/1X0A2JC3.htm#"><img class="contentImg" title="Photo: Embracing the WeChat platform: Global brands." border="0" alt="Photo: Embracing the WeChat platform: Global brands." src="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/resources/MI_Portal/Article/imn/2015/06/469848/1434092574787_15-6-1c1-3_469848.jpg"/></a><figcaption><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Embracing

brands.</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">According to data from Tencent, the holding company behind 
WeChat, the platform has 450 million monthly active users, with that 
number continuing to rise. Explaining the popularity of the system, Zhao 
Junfeng, General Manager of Fengze Yuanta, a Henan-based entrepreneur&#39;s 
association, said: &quot;Everyone wants to start their own business. WeChat commerce fits in perfectly with those aspirations.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&quot;There are very few restrictions on those looking open WeChat shops. 
They don&#39;t have to rent shop space or stock up on large quantities of goods. All 
they have to do is to post photos and short product descriptions on 
WeChat, QQ and other platforms.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&quot;From a sales point of view, WeChat commerce is about &#39;inner circle&#39; 
marketing. WeChat&#39;s circle of business has a unique advantage. Once 
trust is established, a business can grow exponentially, expanding at an amazing 
speed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">For many, the key advantage of WeChat commerce seems to lie in its 
seamless online-to-offline user acquisition facility. The platform began life as 
a social networking tool, rather than a marketing tool. As such, it can target 
user groups more accurately and connect big data more effectively than 
traditional e-commerce systems. This enables businesses to substantially improve 
their levels of service and secure more orders.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">WeChat commerce represents a form of &#39;decentralized&#39; e-commerce as 
far as most companies are concerned. It scores over Taobao, a more 
PC-focussed system, in a number of ways. Most traditional retailing companies 
failed to turn a profit via Taobao, largely because of problems with 
customer acquisition. The problem was aggravated by the fact that users who 
placed orders on B2C or C2C shops were, in effect, customers of Taobao rather than of the third-party vendors. As a result, such merchants had no 
direct channels of communications with buyers and could not determine more 
specific user requirements.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">By contrast, WeChat commerce succeeds by allowing vendors to 
assemble potential customers from a variety of sources in order to form their 
own Big Data customer database. This facilitates the use of personalized 
recommendations and more targetted marketing.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">As a customer management platform, WeChat eliminates all 
intermediate stages and ensures unimpeded communication with customers from 
different channels. Vendors can, thus, establish direct contact with consumers 
using their public accounts.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">According to a number of industry sources the expectation is now that the 
retail sector will be more or less equally split (3:3:4) between e-commerce, 
WeChat commerce and traditional retailing. Taobao cannot 
completely undercut traditional retailing, while neither can WeChat overturn Taobao. As a result, the three channels are expected to 
coexist for a long time to come. It is predicted that WeChat commerce 
will account for 30% of retail sales channels in future.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Overall, some four elements are seen as essential for the future growth of 
B2C WeChat commerce – a sound transaction platform, a social 
media-driven distribution system, a social media-driven customer relations 
management system and an adequate after-sales rights protection 
mechanism.</span></p></div></div></div><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><strong>WeChat and Cosmetics</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">In terms of specific applications within the beauty sector, Shanghai&#39;s 
Kans Cosmetics claims to have broken through the Rmb100 million marks 
in terms of monthly turnover, while bringing its number of franchisees to more 
than 20,000, within just a few months of switching to WeChat marketing. 
According to Chen Yuxin, Vice-president and General Manager of the company&#39;s O2O 
WeChat marketing department, Kans now aims to achieve an 
annual turnover of Rmb1.5 billion via WeChat commerce in 2015. As a 
result of its use of the platform, the Kans&#39; brand went viral and was 
subsequently able to raise its first-round capital.</span></p><div class="mce-template"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 img-md img-right"><div class="tmce_placeholder"><figure><a href="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/International-Market-News/Global-and-Domestic-Cosmetic-Brands-Bid-for-Market-Share-via-WeChat/imn/en/1/1X3AYEO6/1X0A2JC3.htm#"><img class="contentImg" title="Photo: Beauty parade: Hong Kong on show." border="0" alt="Photo: Beauty parade: Hong Kong on show." src="http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/resources/MI_Portal/Article/imn/2015/06/469848/1434092778183_15-6-1c1-2_469848.jpg"/></a><figcaption><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Beauty

surprise that Elizabeth Arden, one of the world&#39;s leading cosmetics 
brands, has announced plans to utilise the platform. At present, the brand is 
said to be facing problems with poorly defined positioning within the mainland 
market, sustaining considerable losses as a result.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">With number of domestic cosmetic brands – notably Pechoin and 
OSM – have already found considerable success via WeChat commerce, Elizabeth Arden launched its marketing campaign on the 
platform Shanghai on in January this year. It hopes that the initiative will 
particularly engage younger consumers.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">In order to make a distinction between its online and offline channels, 
Elizabeth Arden has launched products and sets specifically for the 
WeChat market. Sets sold on WeChat at Rmb698 are priced at 
more than Rmb2,000 at makeup counters. The company entered China as an upmarket 
brand and has established its exclusive positioning partly on account of its 
high prices.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Now, when any of its products fail to find a market via conventional 
retailing, it turns to its WeChat channel. WeChat marketing 
became Elizabeth Ardern&#39;s primary strategy for success on the mainland 
market after acquisition moves by Korea&#39;s LG foundered last year.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The China Beauty Expo 2015 took place at the Shanghai New International 
Expo Centre between 19-21 May.</span></p></div></div></div><p><br/></p>  </div>
